<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Worthiness Checker

<img src="./src/screenshot2.png" height="auto" width="auto" style="border-radius:20px" >

Our project is a Chrome Extension for Checkworthy Tweet Detection. We built this extension to help users distinguish the truth from fake information on social media. 
<br>

Reason why we picked Chrome extension as a platform:
* A natural place of using text information retrieval techniques
* Efficient way to demonstrate outcomes
* Generality and easy to interact with web pages

<br>
Social Media can be one of the most significant carriers of information that handles a great extent of information exchange in our daily lives. However, false and deceptive information could slip in and take advantage of the effectiveness of Social Media to spread widely and cause massive harm to users with no means to tell the worthiness of info. Thus, it is critical to provide each user a way to deterministically find out the authenticity of posts and news on social media.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Our project mainly consists of two parts: the "Front-end" Chrome extension and the Back-end server based on Python Flask.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### **Dependencies**

We have used backend `app.py` to handle API requests, to install dependencies for running, simply locate to our project folder and do
* pip install
  ```sh
  pip3 install -r ./backend/requirements.txt
  ```

### Running the local server

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

1. Make sure you have installed **Dependencies** in the previous step
2. Make sure you are located our project folder where the following folders exist:
   - `./backend`
   - `./extension`
3. Enter the folder `backend` using
   ```sh
   cd ./backend
   ```
4. Start the server using
   ```sh
   python3 app.py
   ```
